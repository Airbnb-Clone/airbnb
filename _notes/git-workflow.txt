Workflow (simplified):

1. git checkout master
2. git pull --rebase upstream master
3. git checkout -b feature-branch
4. edit/git add/git commit
5. git pull --rebase upstream master
6. git push origin feature-branch
7. Submit PR

---- PR Merge Successful ----

8. git checkout master
9. git pull --rebase upstream master
10. Remove the branch from your local workstation
	--> get checkout master
	--> git branch -d feature-branch

---- PR Merge Unsuccessful ----

8. Make more commits to feature-branch
9. git pull --rebase upstream master
10. git push origin feature-branch



Workflow (in-depth):

-------------------------- PART ONE --------------------------

[  ] Create an organization for your team
	-->[  ] Have each member join that organization

[  ] Create a repo for your project
	-->[  ] Have each member fork the org's repo to their own github accounts


[  ] Clone down your fork 
	--> git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/airbnb

[  ] Add the organization's version of the repo as an upstream remote
	--> git remote add upstream https://github.com/airbnb_clone/airbnb

-------------------------- PART TWO --------------------------
> Making and submitting changes

[  ] Before beginning, make sure you're on your local master branch
	--> get checkout master

[  ] Everytime you begin making a new set of changes, make sure your local master branch is in-sync with the org's master branch 
	--> git pull --rebase upstream master

[  ] Leave local master as simply an up-to-date copy of your organization's master. If you plan on making changes, create a branch specific to the changes you wish to make

[  ] Create your feature branch by doing 
	--> git checkout -b feature-branch

[  ] Commit frequently

[  ] Before you submit changes for review:
	--> git pull --rebase upstream master

[  ] With all changes incorporated, push up to origin
	--> git push origin feature-branch 

[  ] Submit a pull request
	--> [  ] Have someone from your team review your code and decide whether or not to merge to the org's master


-------------------------- PULL REQUEST --------------------------

****** If the pull request is successful ******



[  ] Clean up your feature branches, as you will no longer need them

[  ] When PR is merged, click the Delete branch button

[  ] Remove the branch from your local workstation
	--> get checkout master
	--> git branch -d feature-branch



****** If the pull request is unsuccessful ******

[  ] Return to your local repo's feature branch and perform additional work

[  ] Make your new commit(s) to the same feature-branch

[  ] Push changes on the feature branch to the origin's feature branch
	--> git push origin feature-branch
